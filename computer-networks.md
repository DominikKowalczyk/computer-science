## Basics of Networking

Computer networks are the backbone of modern communication, enabling the exchange of information between devices. Understanding the basics of networking is essential for anyone navigating the digital landscape.

### Key Concepts

1. **Nodes and Links:** Devices like computers, routers, and servers are nodes, and the connections between them are links.

2. **Topology:** The arrangement of nodes and links in a network. Common topologies include bus, star, ring, and mesh.

3. **Protocols:** Rules and conventions governing communication between devices. Protocols ensure standardized data exchange.

4. **IP Addressing:** Every device on a network has a unique IP address, allowing for identification and communication.

5. **Routing:** The process of directing data between nodes on a network.

## OSI Model

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers. Each layer performs specific tasks, and communication between layers is well-defined.

1. **Physical Layer:** Deals with the physical connection between devices, including cables and hardware.

2. **Data Link Layer:** Manages the flow of data between nodes on a network segment, providing error detection and correction.

3. **Network Layer:** Handles routing and forwarding, ensuring data reaches its destination across different networks.

4. **Transport Layer:** Manages end-to-end communication, breaking down larger messages into smaller packets for transmission.

5. **Session Layer:** Establishes, maintains, and terminates communication sessions between applications.

6. **Presentation Layer:** Translates data between the application layer and the lower layers, ensuring compatibility.

7. **Application Layer:** Provides network services directly to end-users or applications.

## TCP/IP Protocol Suite

The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is the fundamental suite of protocols that powers the internet. It consists of four layers:

1. **Link Layer:** Equivalent to the combination of the OSI model's physical and data link layers.

2. **Internet Layer:** Corresponds to the network layer in the OSI model, responsible for routing and addressing.

3. **Transport Layer:** Similar to the OSI model's transport layer, managing end-to-end communication.

4. **Application Layer:** Encompasses the OSI model's top three layers, providing network services to applications.

## Internet Protocols

### HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

HTTP is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and actions to be taken by web servers and browsers.

### [DNS (Domain Name System)](domain-name-system.md)

DNS translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses, facilitating the identification of devices on a network.

### SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)

SMTP is used for the transmission of emails, enabling the transfer of messages between servers.

Understanding the basics of networking, the OSI model, TCP/IP protocol suite, and internet protocols is crucial for navigating the interconnected world of digital communication.
